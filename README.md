A professional, fintech-grade React + TypeScript application designed for traders to calculate optimal position sizes using robust risk management principles.

---

## 🚀 Key Simulations & Features

- **Optimal Position Sizing**: Calculates the exact **Notional Value** you should allocate based on your risk appetite and trade geometry.
- **Account Growth Projection**: A dynamic simulator that visualizes how your account balance evolves over time based on win rate, risk/reward, and compounding.
- **Risk/Reward Scenarios**: Instantly see your potential Profit/Loss across different R:R targets (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc.) tailored to your entry.
- **Premium Fintech UI**: Modern "Glassmorphism" interface with full Dark/Light mode support, featuring a custom design system built with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Native support for English and Vietnamese, including localized numeric formatting.
- **Responsive & Persistent**: Mobile-first design that remembers your settings (Capital, Risk %) via Local Storage for a seamless workflow.

## 🧪 The Formula

The calculator computes the **Notional Position Size** (Value) rather than just unit count, making it applicable to any asset class (Stocks, Forex, Crypto):

```text
Risk Amount = Capital × Risk %
Stop Loss % = |Entry Price - Stop Loss Price| ÷ Entry Price
Position Size (Value) = Risk Amount ÷ Stop Loss %
```

**Example:**

- **Capital**: $10,000
- **Risk %**: 2% ($200 at risk)
- **Entry**: $100
- **Stop Loss**: $95 (5% drop)
- **Position Size**: $200 ÷ 0.05 = **$4,000**
